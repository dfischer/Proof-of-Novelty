# Proof of Novelty


[![Paper](http://img.shields.io/badge/severo_d_1-arxiv-B31B1B.svg)](https://arxiv.org/a/severo_d_1.html)


We propose a design for securing novelty of archived content in distributed ledgers, called *Proof of Novelty*. What constitutes as novel is decided through a consensus mechanism together with a similarity function, which is selected according to the content type (e.g. full-motion videos, textual documents). Scalability is guaranteed by forming a validation committee with cryptographic sortition, which use statistical hypothesis testing to decide on the probability of a content being novel or not. The system can trade-off computational with statistical performance by manipulating parameters. We discuss the usage of this design to secure the novelty of full-motion videos and end with a proposal of future lines of research that can extended the systems capabilities.
